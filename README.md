# Zuub Stedi Fuzz Tester

_A high-performance Rust tool for generating realistic Stedi API responses and fuzz testing integrations_

---

## Overview

The **Zuub Stedi Fuzz Tester** is built to simulate real-world API behaviors with precision. By generating diverse and realistic responses for the Stedi API, this tool helps you uncover edge cases, vulnerabilities, and integration pitfalls before they reach production.

---

## Why Build This Tool?

- **Realistic API Simulation:**  
  Create lifelike responses that mimic the nuances of live API behavior, enabling you to test your systems under authentic conditions.

- **Robust Fuzz Testing:**  
  The tool employs fuzz testing—injecting random, unexpected, or malformed data into your API—to identify issues that traditional tests might overlook. This approach is vital for exposing hidden bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks that only manifest under unusual conditions.

- **Permutation Testing:**  
  In addition to random fuzzing, the tool can generate multiple permutations of input parameters. By testing various combinations, it ensures that your API can gracefully handle a wide spectrum of input scenarios, even those at the limits of expected usage.

- **High Performance & Safety:**  
  Written in Rust, the tool harnesses Rust’s speed and memory safety features, ensuring reliable and efficient testing.

- **Easy Configuration:**  
  Tweak server settings, logging, error rates, and more through simple TOML configuration files—customize the simulation to mirror your production environment as closely as possible.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Reliability:**  
  Identify integration bugs and performance issues early, ensuring smooth production deployments.

- **Improved Security:**  
  Expose vulnerabilities by testing with a broad range of input scenarios, thereby reinforcing your system’s security posture.

- **Time Efficiency:**  
  Automate repetitive testing tasks, reducing manual effort and accelerating your development cycle.

- **Modular & Extensible:**  
  A clean, modular codebase allows for easy customization and scaling to fit your testing needs.

- **In-depth Exposure of Edge Cases:**  
  Fuzz testing and permutation testing expose unexpected behavior—such as data format errors, input overflows, or rare error paths—helping you avoid scenarios that might cause crashes or security breaches in production.

## Features

- **Realistic Stedi API Responses:**  
  Generate accurate responses with dynamic parameters to mimic live environments.

- **Comprehensive Integration Tests:**  
  A dedicated suite of tests (found in `tests/integration_tests.rs`) ensures your API interactions are robust.

- **Detailed Logging:**  
  Configurable logging levels help you trace and debug issues with precision.

- **Flexible Configuration:**  
  Use the provided `config/default.toml` and `config/test.toml` files to adjust server address, port, log levels, and more.

- **Modular Architecture:**  
  Separate modules handle core logic, configuration, API handling, and utility functions for a well-organized codebase.

## Installation

Ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed, then clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/copyleftdev/zuub-stedi-fuzz-tester.git
cd zuub-stedi-fuzz-tester

# Build the project in release mode
cargo build --release
```

Some developers may not fully appreciate the importance of fuzz and permutation testing. This tool is designed to simulate a wide range of possible API inputs—including malformed and unexpected data—to reveal bugs and vulnerabilities that typical testing might miss. This means you’ll get early warnings of potential crashes, security issues, or performance hiccups before they reach production.

---

## Usage

Start the server to begin fuzz testing and API simulation:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

To run the integration tests and verify functionality:

```bash
cargo test
```

---

## Configuration

Customize the tool’s behavior via TOML configuration files:

- **Default Settings:**  
  Edit `config/default.toml` for production-like configurations (server address, port, log level, etc.).

- **Test Settings:**  
  Adjust `config/test.toml` for a controlled testing environment with parameters like response delay and error rate.
